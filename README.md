The React frontend is a pure Single-Page Application (SPA) deployed statically on Vercel. It communicates via a REST API with the Node.js/Express backend, which runs as a serverless function, also on Vercel, for scalability and efficiency.

Set Up the Backend (giggy-server)# Clone the server repository
git clone httpss://[github.com/your-username/giggy-server.git](https://github.com/your-username/giggy-server.git)
cd giggy-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create an environment file
touch .env
Now, open the .env file and add your secret credentials. This file is ignored by Git to keep your keys safe..env# Your MongoDB connection string from Atlas
DB_URI="mongodb+srv://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@cluster.mongodb.net/yourDbName?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# You can name your user and pass anything, this is for MongoDB connection string
DB_USER="your_db_user"
DB_PASS="your_db_password"
2. Set Up the Frontend (giggy-client)# In a new terminal, clone the client repository
git clone httpss://[github.com/your-username/giggy-client.git](https://github.com/your-username/giggy-client.git)
cd giggy-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create the environment file for Firebase keys
touch .env.local
Now, open .env.local and add your Firebase project's configuration keys. You can find these in your Firebase project settings..env.local# These keys are safe to expose on the client-side

3. Run the ApplicationStart the backend server by running npm start or node index.js in the giggy-server directory.Start the frontend development server by running npm run dev in the giggy-client directory.The application should now be live on http://localhost:5173 (or your configured Vite port)!üìû ContactTanvee Faiyaz - LinkedIn - tanveefaiyaz@gmail.comProject Link: httpss://github.com/tanveefaiyaz/giggy-client
