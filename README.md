## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The project is built on a modern MERN-like stack, with each piece carefully chosen for its role.

### Architecture

GIGGY uses a classic client-server model. The **React frontend** is a pure Single-Page Application (SPA) deployed statically on Firebase Hosting. It communicates via a REST API with the **Node.js/Express backend**, which runs as a serverless function on Vercel for scalability and efficiency. **MongoDB Atlas** serves as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database.
